# dataStructure

Implement All Data Structure(linked list, queue, stack, Heaps, BST, AVL Tree)

## I implemented queues in two different ways

- One of them based on array
- Another based on linked list

## I implemented stack in two different ways

- One of them based on array
- Another based on linked list

## I implemented arrayList based on array

## I implemented LinkedList in Three Types

- First: Single linked List
- Second: Doubly linked List
- Third: Circular Linked List

## I implemented BST(Binary Search Tree)

## I implemented AVLTree(Balanced Binary Search Tree)
